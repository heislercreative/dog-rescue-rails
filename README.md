# Dog Rescue Shelter App

This Rails app serves as an interface between shelter staff, volunteer workers, and prospective adopters. It allows admin staff to add adoptable dogs, users to adopt, and all users to create and attend shelter events.

## Installation & Usage

To start using the app, clone the repository, run `bundle` to install all necessary gems, `rake db:migrate` to create the database tables, and `thin start --ssl` to launch the web server. Navigate to https://localhost:3000 to view the app.

To load demo content, run `rake db:seed` before viewing in the browser.

### Test
1. Visit the Sign Up page to create a new account or sign up with Facebook Omniauth.
- The first user signed up will become the shelter admin (able to edit/delete other user accounts).
2. Once logged in (through signup or login pages):
- Each patient can have a list of conditions with details including diagnosis and treatment dates.
- Both patients and their conditions can be edited and/or deleted.
